Model description


1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Mounted Google Drive and downloaded the Fruit 360 dataset from Kaggle.
   - Converted images to arrays for both training and testing datasets.
   - Converted these arrays into grayscale and flattened them.
   - Converted the flattened arrays into CSV format for both training and testing datasets.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualized some samples from the training dataset using matplotlib.

3. **Data Balancing Check:**
   - Checked whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced by plotting the distribution of labels.

4. **Preprocessing:**
   - Scaled the features using MinMaxScaler.
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
   - Trained a KNN classifier on the training data.
   - Used cross-validation to find the optimal value of k.
   - Tested the final accuracy of the KNN model on the test data.

6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - For the full dataset:
     - Defined a parameter grid for GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
     - Performed grid search to find the best SVM model.
   - For a smaller dataset:
     - Randomly sampled 1000 entries from the dataset.
     - Applied SVM using GridSearchCV on this smaller dataset.
