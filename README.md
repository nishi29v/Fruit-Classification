# Fruit-Classification
This project classifies fruit images using the Fruit 360 dataset. Images are converted to CSV files, normalized, and visualized with PCA. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained and evaluated to compare their performance in fruit image classification.
